    What is a Game?
    
    <notes>
      - Defined by amusement fails -> what about a Chess Grandmaster?
      - Defined by competition fails -> what about Solitaire?
      - Defined by rules fails (but not by much) -> what about Mao? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game))

    <notes>
      1930s - Ludwig Wittgenstein
       - One of the first academic philosophers that addressed the definition of the word game
       - Lots of interesting facts
        - Born in Vienna into one of Europe's richest families (2nd only to the Rothschilds)
        - Wittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart and went to the same school for a time
        - Served as an officer on the front line during WW1, and sectretly as an orderly in WW2
       - Argued that we don't have a true definition of the word game, and we don't need one
       - Elements such as play, rules, and competition fail to adequately define what a game is
